## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I recently learned flexbox to align containers and elements respectively. A big confusion I had was to adjust or adapt the content to the correct screen size with *media query.* Its use is to adjust to different screen sizes and viewports, so anyone can browse the content (any project) from any device, be it a mobile or desktop.

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 425px) and (max-width: 1440px) {
  .layout-container {
    width: 320px;
    margin: 100px auto;
  }
}
```

I needed this realistic project to start off my HTML, CSS, and GIT and GITHUB skills.

### Continued development

This challange helped me to understand how important is *media query* to make my future projects a better responsive design, focusing on flexbox, grid, and proper alignment. 

I will continue to expand my knowledge by practicing ways to use HTML semantic structure and CSS flexbox design.

### Useful resources

- [How to "make a site responsive" and use Media Queries well](https://fedmentor.dev/posts/responsive-meaning/) - This helped me understand the concepts of how to make a responsive site. It really guided me on how I should start this project in the first place. So, I decided to code all the features for a mobile screen size, which I started with 375px as per the requirement of this project.

- [DevDocs API Documentation](https://devdocs.io/) - This is an amazing website which helped me finally understand some of the elements I implemented on this project. It is a easy way to learn, and I'd recommend it to anyone.

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to the Frontend Mentor community and especially to Grace Snow who provided me with resource #1. It gave me a clear concept of what a responsive site means and its functions.

I will continue working on more projects to improve my programming skills. There is a great variety of front-end development projects for those looking for a way to start their coding career. I highly recommend it. 

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.
